# Desion | Translation

## How do you support translation?

Translate the language folder in the `/languages` file to the language you want and send it to us as a Pull Request. When you submit, we will check and if appropriate we will ask you for your discord id, if you have it, your role will be handed over. And your language will be added in about 1 hour after your discord ID is requested.
